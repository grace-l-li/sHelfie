Example of flipping book CSS: https://youtu.be/Ge2oXl-KnVw?si=2bYRlFF6Pgz4YrGS
Note: The version of the flipping book from the video was very buggy and did not work so we had to debug and also adjust the styling/CSS to our desires.

GoogleBooks API allows for the search of books and also all the book information alongside the links for the books for more info.

Grace created the API methods for the login system, adding and deleting books to particular sections, and creating the friends/post systems.

ChatGPT and Github Co-pilot for debugging and creating ways to solve some of our issues were also used in the process.

# Shelfie

Rather than sharing a selfie, share your Shelfie!

Shelfie is an interactive book social media platform that allows users to share their read, to be read, and currently reading books through their profile. 
You must have friends to view post updates in the feed (as well as add books to one of your subpages). We recommend marking books in all three categories and giving a rating or review to a book to have a comprehensive experience. Add friends by searching for their username and visiting their profile. Accept friends on the home page under “Friend Requests.” Having more than three books marked as read will also show the layering effect of the Read subpage (adds a shelf with every row).
